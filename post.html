    <article>
        <div class="container">

                    <p>If you've ever visited an apple farm, it's natural to look for the best apples on the tree, not the bruised ones that lie on the ground. And sometimes we assume that God does exactly the same thing when he looks at us. But He doesn't. He sees the bruised apples and still picks them up and places them in His basket.</p>

                    <p>You may be that bruised apple, wounded from the wickedness of the world, battered by guilt and condemnation. God is telling you that you are just as important to Him as the other 'perfect' apples. No matter how bruised you are, His love is ever-present and sufficient for you. As 1 Samuel 16:7 reminds us,</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.</h2>

                    <br>
                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

                    <p>Are you the sort of person that is always thinking about how others are more beautiful than you, more talented ... even more spiritual? When we do that, we're forgetting what God has said about us. This leads to us feeling less of ourselves and even believing the lies the devil tells us through the media. We forget who we are and start chasing after shadows, trying so hard to fit into the world's standards and forgetting our faith in the process.</p>

                    <p>So don't be afraid to be loved by God. Live abundantly in His love and grace. Don't live your life depending on what others think of you. You may be one of his bruised apples, but you are worth far more than you can ever fathom. To know that God sent His only son to die for you is incredible. You were bought with a price and therefore you belong to Him. The scripture says that we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works which He has created us to do. So no more going around feeling defeated - instead, remember you are favored, loved and cherished by God.</p>

                    <p>God's love is relentless, so explore the vast greatness of His immeasurable love. Open your heart and embrace who you are in Jesus Christ. And as you do, here are some Scriptures to encourage you and help you pray:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>

                        <li>Romans 8:33, 35, 37-39</li>
                        <li>Isaiah 54:10,17</li>
